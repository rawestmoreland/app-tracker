# Jobble Brand Kit - Designer Brief

**Project**: Jobble Job Application Tracker
**Date**: October 2025
**Contact**: Richard W

---

## Project Overview

Jobble is a job application tracking platform that helps users "juggle" multiple job applications with ease. The name is a playful combination of "job" + "juggle," which is central to our brand identity. We have an existing functional product with a design system in place, and we're looking to refine and professionalize our brand identity.

---

## Your Questions Answered

### 1. Existing Color Palette & Typography

**Yes, we have an established design system** that we'd like you to work within and refine:

#### Current Color Palette

Our primary brand color is **Jobble Blue (#3B82F6)**, which is used throughout the product. We'd like you to:

- Keep Jobble Blue as the primary brand color
- Refine the supporting color palette if needed
- Ensure colors work well together and maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
- The current palette includes functional colors (green for success, orange for warnings, red for errors, purple and pink for personality)

#### Current Typography

We use **Geist Sans** (by Vercel) as our primary typeface:

- Modern, geometric, highly readable
- Works well for both UI and marketing
- We're open to you selecting a complementary display font for hero sections or marketing materials if you think it would enhance the brand
- Current hierarchy uses weights from 400 (regular) to 700 (bold)

**Feel free to**:

- Refine the type scale and hierarchy
- Suggest improvements to spacing and sizing
- Add a display/accent font if it would strengthen the brand identity

---

### 2. Mascot Vision: "Jobble"

We already have an **illustrative, friendly mascot character** that needs professional refinement.

#### Current Mascot Characteristics

- **Style**: Friendly, rounded blob character with multiple arms
- **Key Visual**: The mascot is actively juggling colorful orbs (representing job applications)
- **Personality**: Supportive, capable, approachable, slightly playful but not childish
- **Color**: Currently Jobble Blue (#3B82F6)

#### What We Need From You

**Option A - Refine Existing Design** (Preferred)

- Polish and professionalize our current mascot concept
- Improve the illustration quality and consistency
- Maintain the "juggling" concept as it's core to our brand
- Keep it friendly and approachable, but ensure it feels professional enough for career-focused users

**Option B - Reimagine** (If you have a strong vision)

- We're open to a reimagined version if you think you can strengthen the concept
- Must maintain the "juggling multiple things" metaphor
- Should feel supportive and capable, not stressed or overwhelmed
- Need to balance "friendly/approachable" with "professional/trustworthy"

#### Style Direction

- **Not too cartoony**: Our users are professionals, from entry-level to senior executives
- **Not too corporate**: Job searching is stressful; we want to feel supportive and human
- **Sweet spot**: Think between Duolingo's owl (too playful) and MailChimp's Freddie (good balance of friendly + professional)

---

### 3. Mascot Poses/Variations

**Yes, we need multiple versions**, as different emotional states help users feel supported throughout their job search journey.

#### Required Variations (Budget Scope)

**Essential (4 variations only)**

1. **Default/Neutral** - Confidently juggling, main brand representation
2. **Celebrating** - For success moments (job offers, interview scheduled)
3. **Thinking** - For planning/strategy sections
4. **Waving** - For welcome/onboarding experiences

We'll handle additional variations in-house if needed later.

#### Technical Requirements

- **Format**: SVG preferred for web scalability
- **Sizes**: Should scale from 64px to 256px without quality loss
- **Consistency**: All variations should feel like the same character
- **Color**: Primarily Jobble Blue, with accent colors for the juggled items

---

### 4. Brand Kit Scope

**This is a budget-focused brand kit.** We need core identity assets only - wordmark and mascot variations.

#### What We Need

**Primary Wordmark**

- "Jobble" text treatment in our brand style
- Can be standalone or incorporate a simple mascot icon
- Works at various sizes (from favicon to hero)
- Exportable as SVG and PNG (@1x, @2x, @3x)

**Mascot Character**

- **4 Essential variations only**: Default (juggling), Celebrating, Thinking, Waving
- Simple, scalable design that works from 64px to 256px
- Each variation as SVG and PNG (@1x, @2x, @3x)

## Target Audience

Our users are:

- **Age**: 22-55 years old
- **Career Level**: Entry-level to senior professionals
- **Industries**: Tech, business, creative, various sectors
- **Psychographics**: Organized, goal-oriented, potentially stressed about job searching
- **Tech Savvy**: Medium to high (comfortable with web applications)

---

## Brand Positioning

### Competitive Landscape

- **Huntr, Teal, JobHero**: Direct competitors, mostly serious/corporate
- **Notion, Airtable**: Indirect competitors, flexible but less job-search specific

### Our Differentiation

- **More personality** than corporate competitors (via mascot)
- **More focused** than general productivity tools
- **Balance**: Professional capability + emotional support

### Brand Voice

- Encouraging but not patronizing
- Professional but not stuffy
- Friendly but not childish
- Clear and helpful, never overwhelming

## Questions for You

Before you provide a quote, we'd love your input on:

4. Provide a flat rate quote and timeline
5. If aligned, we'll move forward!

We're looking for a straightforward process and clean deliverables. Excited to work with you!
